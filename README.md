This game was submitted as a group final project in Queen's University's Fundamentals of Software Development Course (CISC 320). This project was 4 into development, with 8 developers. 

As a game designer, I was responsible for creating visually appealing and engaging elements for the game. I designed fun and compelling graphical elements that enhanced the overall aesthetic of the game and made it more enjoyable for players. In addition to this, the team constructed the level's layout and interactable gameplay objects, such as platforms, power-ups, and enemies. The levels were designed to be challenging and entertaining, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the game world. To bring the levels to life, we also implemented a 2D physics engine, which used collision detection and response to create realistic and interactive gameplay. The result was a game that was both aesthetically pleasing and mechanically engaging, providing players with a truly enjoyable experience.
